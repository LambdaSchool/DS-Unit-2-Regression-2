    "\n",
    "> **5. Develop a model that overfits.** The universal tension in machine learning is between optimization and generalization; the ideal model is one that stands right at the border between underfitting and overfitting; between undercapacity and overcapacity. To figure out where this border lies, first you must cross it.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **6. Regularize your model and tune its hyperparameters, based on performance on the validation data.** Repeatedly modify your model, train it, evaluate on your validation data (not the test data, at this point), modify it again, and repeat, until the model is as good as it can get. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Iterate on feature engineering: add new features, or remove features that don’t seem to be informative.** Once you’ve developed a satisfactory model configuration, you can train your final production model on all the available data (training and validation) and evaluate it one last time on the test set.\n"
